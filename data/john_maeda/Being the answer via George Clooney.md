## Blog Post:

Last week with the loss of Steve Jobs I’m a bit off balance like many out there. I shared some of [my thoughts](http://www.npr.org/2011/10/07/141144758/remembering-how-steve-jobs-changed-the-design-world) with NPR’s Morning Edition, but am still way bummed right now. I clip a lot of things out of magazines and the likes and put them in my wallet, and rifling through it this morning I found something that gave me a needed smile. It’s from [an interview](http://parade.com/133493/davidgergen/what-drives-george-clooney/) with actor George Clooney on the topic of failure from Parade Magazine.

**You’ve talked about how lucky you are. What have you learned from your failures?**

> _It’s hard when you get thumped. I’ve been proficient at failure. But the only thing you can do is say, “Here’s what I won’t do next time.”

> I was a baseball player in school. I had a good arm, I could catch anything, but I was having trouble hitting. I would be like, “I wonder if I’ll hit it; just let me hit the ball.” And then I went away for the fall, learned how to hit, and by my sophomore year I’d come to the plate and think, “I wonder where I want to hit the ball, to the left or right?” Just that little bit of skill and confidence changed everything. Well, I had to treat acting like that. I had to stop going to auditions thinking, “Oh, I hope they like me.” I had to go in thinking I was the answer to their problem. You could feel the difference in the room immediately.

> _The greatest lesson I learned was that sometimes you have to fake it. And you have to be willing to fail._

Thanks George. Thanks Steve. -JM

Parade Magazine used to be a staple for me growing up, and unfortunately it's now no bigger than a staple …
