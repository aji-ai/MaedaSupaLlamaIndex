# MaedaSupaLlamaIndex
 
This is an example of using [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) with [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) that I made earlier this year but never got around to sharing. 

It seems a bit silly to do all this when we now have Azure OpenAI Assistants API instead ... but I thought it useful to keep this around in my head just in case I want to get more RAG-y in the future.

Enjoy! â€”JM

## How to get going
